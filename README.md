# AWS Lex Chatbot for Customer Interaction

This project is an AI-powered chatbot built using **AWS Lex** and **AWS Lambda**, designed to enhance customer experience for Tomorrow's AI. It provides quick answers to FAQs, showcases services and case studies, and enables users to schedule consultations directly. The chatbot is configured with **20+ intents**, each offering unique interactions to guide users through different processes.

For simplicity, I've included only a few example conversations rather than the entire flow to keep it easy to follow. You can explore the full chatbot experience on [Tomorrow's AI Website](https://www.tomorrowsai.org).

## Demo

To see the bot in action, watch the video below:

## Development Process

### 1. Intent Design
Each intent includes:
- **Utterances**: User inputs that trigger the intent (e.g., "Tell me about your services").
- **Response**: A dynamic message that may include clickable options or follow-up questions.

#### Example: View Services Intent
- **Utterances**:
  - "What services do you offer?"
  - "Tell me about your services."
- **Response**:
  - "Here are our top services:"  
    - Marketing & Business Development  
    - Data & AI Solutions  
    - Custom Software & Generative AI  
    - Consulting, Strategy & Development  
    (with clickable options as cards)

#### Example Conversation Flow
- **User**: "Hello"  
- **Bot**: "Hello! Welcome to Tomorrow's AI. How can I assist you today?"  
  - Options:
    - Learn about our services
    - Explore case studies & success
    - Book a consultation

- **User**: "Learn about our services"  
- **Bot**: "Here are our services:"  
  - Marketing & Business Development  
  - Data & AI Solutions  
  - Custom Software & Generative AI  
  - Consulting, Strategy & Development

- **User**: "Tell me more about Marketing & Business Development"  
- **Bot**: "Marketing & Business Development Services"  
  - Options:
    - Show me success stories
    - Tell me about your software solutions

- **User**: "Tell me more about success stories"  
- **Bot**: "Here are some success stories..."  
  - Options:
    - Yes, get me started!
    - Tell me more about your packages and pricing

#### Booking Intent
- **Utterances**:
  - "I want to book a consultation."
  - "Book a meeting."
- **Response**:
  - "Great! I can help you schedule your consultation. Please provide the following details:"  
    - Name  
    - Preferred date and time  
    - Timezone  
    - A brief description of the problem you want to fix in your business.

#### Lambda Integration for Bookings
- Once the user provides their booking details, **AWS Lambda** processes the information and:
  - Creates a new event in **Google Calendar**.
  - Schedules a **Google Meet** meeting for a phone or video call.
  - Sends confirmation details to the user.

## Testing & Debugging
- **Test with Lex Console**: Ensure intents trigger correctly by using the built-in test window.
- **Monitor with CloudWatch Logs**: Capture logs for debugging errors and monitoring chatbot interactions.
  
## Challenges and Learnings

- **Challenge 1**: Handling multi-turn conversations without confusion.
- **Solution**: Using **session attributes** to store context between turns.
